Memory: Assignment # 4
Purpose: The purpose of this program is to simulate computer memory.
It contains functions to store and retrieve ints to and from memory
locations as well as a funtion to copy a block of memory to another 
location and a funtion to dump with contents of a specified block of
memory.


Comments:The code runs great but valgrind says there is a memory error even though
it also states there is no leaks possible. I wasn't able to work out what the memory error was
